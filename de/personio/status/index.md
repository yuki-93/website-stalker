[Partial service disruption](https://status.personio.de/incidents/hh0wqd8y5rnm)

**Resolved** - Resolved - We experienced issues with the Attendance module between 15:18 to 15:36 CEST

The following specific functionality was affected:
\- Attendance Days approvals via workflows (wrongly auto-approved)

Our team took the following actions:
\- Wrongly auto-approved attendance days were reopened and approval requests were sent to the correct approvers
\- Investigation was conducted for wrongly auto-approved employee attribute changes

All other system components remained stable and operated as expected throughout this incident. Our engineering teams worked to implement a comprehensive solution.
